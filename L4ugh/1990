It is easy to understand that this sound was used in older phones with a characteristic sounds

I tried to check it in audio spectrum analyzer and got:

But this way was hard for me to detect unequivocally the Hz of these sounds

I used specialise [service](http://dialabc.com/sound/detect/) to detect the buttons, which were tapped and I got:

66#666#8#33#888#33#777#999#8#44#444#66#4#666#66#7777#2#6#33#9#2#999#

And it is not hard to decode message, that i recieved:

NOTEVERYTHINGONSAMEWAY

Answer is 0xL4ugh{NOTEVERYTHINGONSAMEWAY}
