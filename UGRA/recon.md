we have a photo from ikea. the task is that we need to calculate the place from where the photo was taken up
to the house.

The first thing I did was try to find the [original image](https://35photo.pro/photo_1222722/) to find the city from which the photo
was taken. I found a photo taken from exactly the same place, but slightly different, as there are different
lights in the windows, but this did not affect the search in any way. The city where the shooting was from was
clear - Omsk

![original](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76822573/109525104-3ec0d100-7ac2-11eb-9c01-ca0d48d167c5.png)

the next goal was to identify some designation in order to understand the approximate location.
In the background of the photo, I noticed a railwaybridge with a certain architecture. there is only 
one such bridge in the city

after some thought and comparison, I realized that the photo was mirrored relative to the original. this made it possible
to understand the approximate area with an accuracy of 2-3 quarters

![location](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76822573/109525552-af67ed80-7ac2-11eb-8496-1caec02a1fc4.png)

the next goal was to determine a more precise position of the house. the photo clearly shows houses with an unusual architectural
solution, namely circles on the house. knowing the approximate location - it was not difficult.

but these houses can be said to be in the background of the photo, we need to be more precise. literally next to the place where
the photo was taken, there is a house similar in shape to the Russian letter G. There were not many such houses in this quarter, 
so this is also there. And finally there is a house with a strange staircase shape. It is located right in front of our house

the answer was most likely a neighboring house, but also at number 38.
flag is: Россия, Омская область, г. Омск, ул. Богдана Хмельницкого, д. 38
